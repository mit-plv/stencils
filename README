 (1) About StLib
 ---------------

  StLib is a Coq library allowing the user to define stencil problems, write
sequential and distributed stencil programs, and provides automation support to
prove their correctness.


 (2) Compilation
 ---------------

 Command           |     Result
-------------------+-------------------------------------------------
 $ make sources    |     Compiles the library
 $ make examples   |     Compiles the examples
 $ make            |     Equivalent to ``$ make sources examples''
 $ make cleanup    |     Cleans up the entire directory
