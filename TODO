Extensions:
 * We need a code extractor.  That involves figuring out the communication
steps (which is non-trivial).
 * Do we want to compiler into the simple Hoare logic scheme I had during my
former internship?

Automation:
 * We need tactics to perform refinement of [valid] goals, on top of the
strategy system.
 * It might be worth having a custom-tailored set-theoretic reasoning tactic,
instead of relying on [firstorder] and mixing it with a few tactics
instanciating existential variables.

Bureaucracy:
 * Write a robust Makefile
 * Add "format" directives for set-theoretic notations.
 * Add "format" directives for abstract strategy notations.
 * Put set-theoretic notations in a separate file.
 * Find uniform names for the lemmas in Sets.v.
 * Hunt unused lemmas down.
 * Check all those "XXX" in the code...
